The final intergalactic instalment in the Skywalker Saga has landed and film critic Lisa Nesselson gives us her take on its enigmatic exchanges, its grammatical anachronisms and, of course, its lightsaber quotient. Also, Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson struggle to maintain a hold on their sanity in "The Lighthouse"; the film sparked a tidal wave of praise at the Cannes Film Festival this year. Next, we check out Chinese noir "The Wild Goose Lake" and its sumptuous vision of a crime underworld where high stakes and extreme tension have its protagonists on the run.

Finally, our film critic tells us why "The Great Escape" captured her imagination as a 5th grader, and why its re-release 56 years later has a lot to teach us about key survival skills.
